# CSS Syntax Structure 2

- **Selectors**
  - Selectors define which HTML elements the style will apply to.
  - Can target elements by:
    - **Type** (e.g., `p`, `h1`): Selects all elements of that type.
    - **Class** (e.g., `.example`): Selects all elements with that class.
    - **ID** (e.g., `#unique`): Selects the element with that specific ID.
    - **Attribute** (e.g., `[type="text"]`): Selects elements with specific attributes.
    - **Combinations**: Can combine selectors to increase specificity or target multiple elements.
  - Example:

    ```css
    .button-primary {
      background-color: green;
      color: white;
    }
    ```

---

# CSS Syntax Structure 3

- **Declaration Block**
  - Enclosed in curly braces `{}`, containing one or more declarations.
  - Each **declaration** has:
    - A **property** (e.g., `color`, `font-size`, `margin`): Defines the aspect of the element to style.
    - A **value** (e.g., `blue`, `16px`, `auto`): Specifies the style applied to that property.
  - Properties and values are separated by a colon (`:`) and end with a semicolon (`;`).
  - Multiple declarations can be added within one declaration block, separated by semicolons.

---

# CSS Syntax Structure 4

- **Importance of Semicolons and Formatting**
  - Semicolons (`;`) are crucial to separate multiple declarations within a block.
  - Correct syntax ensures styles are applied as expected.
  - Formatting with proper indentation and line breaks improves readability and maintainability.

---

# CSS Syntax Structure 5

- **Example of a Complex CSS Rule**
  - Example:

    ```css
    #header .nav-item:hover {
      background-color: #333;
      color: #fff;
      border-bottom: 2px solid orange;
    }
    ```

  - In this example:
    - Selector `#header .nav-item:hover` targets `.nav-item` elements within an element with the ID `header` when hovered.
    - The declarations set background and text color and add a border effect on hover.

---

# CSS Colors: Basics

- **What Are CSS Colors?**
  - CSS colors define the appearance of elements by specifying color values for properties like `color`, `background-color`, `border-color`, etc.
  - Colors enhance visual appeal and are essential for readability, branding, and design aesthetics.

- **Common CSS Color Properties:**
  - `color`: Changes text color.
  - `background-color`: Sets the background color of an element.
  - `border-color`: Defines border color.

- **Example:**

  ```css
  p {
    color: darkgreen;
    background-color: lightyellow;
  }
  ```

---

# CSS Colors: Named Colors

- **What Are Named Colors?**
  - CSS provides 140 named colors (e.g., `red`, `blue`, `lightgray`) that can be directly used without specifying values.
  - Named colors are simple to remember and use, making them convenient for quick styling.

- **Examples of Named Colors:**
  - Primary colors: `red`, `green`, `blue`
  - Neutral colors: `black`, `white`, `gray`
  - Other examples: `cyan`, `magenta`, `orange`, `violet`

- **Usage Example:**

  ```css
  h1 {
    color: tomato;
  }
  ```

---

# CSS Colors: Hexadecimal Notation

- **What Is Hexadecimal Notation?**
  - Hex codes represent colors using a six-digit code (e.g., `#RRGGBB`), where `RR`, `GG`, and `BB` stand for red, green, and blue values.
  - Each pair ranges from `00` to `FF`, with `00` being no color and `FF` being full color.

- **Examples of Hex Codes:**
  - Black: `#000000`
  - White: `#FFFFFF`
  - Red: `#FF0000`
  - Example with shorthand: `#F00` (same as `#FF0000`)

- **Usage Example:**

  ```css
  div {
    background-color: #3498db;
  }
  ```

---

# CSS Colors: RGB and RGBA

- **What Are RGB and RGBA?**
  - RGB stands for Red, Green, Blue. Colors are specified with values between 0 and 255 for each component.
  - RGBA adds an alpha channel for transparency, ranging from 0 (fully transparent) to 1 (fully opaque).

- **Syntax and Examples:**
  - RGB: `rgb(255, 0, 0)` (red)
  - RGBA: `rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5)` (semi-transparent red)

- **Usage Example:**

  ```css
  .overlay {
    background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.7);
  }
  ```

---

# CSS Colors: HSL and HSLA

- **What Are HSL and HSLA?**
  - HSL stands for Hue, Saturation, Lightness. Hue is given as a degree (0â€“360), Saturation and Lightness are percentages.
  - HSLA adds an alpha channel for transparency, similar to RGBA.

- **Syntax and Examples:**
  - HSL: `hsl(240, 100%, 50%)` (blue)
  - HSLA: `hsla(240, 100%, 50%, 0.3)` (semi-transparent blue)

- **Usage Example:**

  ```css
  .highlight {
    color: hsl(120, 60%, 70%);
  }
  ```

---

# CSS Colors: Advanced Techniques

- **Opacity and Transparency**
  - Use `opacity` to set transparency for an entire element. Ranges from 0 (transparent) to 1 (opaque).
  - RGBA/HSLA for specific color transparency.

- **CSS Gradients**
  - Create transitions between multiple colors.
  - **Linear Gradient**: `background: linear-gradient(to right, red, yellow);`
  - **Radial Gradient**: `background: radial-gradient(circle, red, yellow, blue);`

---

# CSS Colors: Advanced Techniques 2

- **Blend Modes and Filters**
  - **Mix-Blend-Mode**: Blends an element with the background (e.g., `multiply`, `screen`).
  - **Filter**: Applies effects like `grayscale()`, `sepia()`, `brightness()`.

- **Example:**

  ```css
  .blend {
    background: url('image.jpg');
    mix-blend-mode: overlay;
  }
  ```
