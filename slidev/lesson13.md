# CSS Box Model: Introduction

### What Is the CSS Box Model?
  - Every element in CSS is a rectangular box that consists of the following areas:
    1. **Content**: The actual content of the element (e.g., text, images).
    2. **Padding**: Space between the content and the border.
    3. **Border**: A line surrounding the padding (or content if no padding).
    4. **Margin**: Space between the border and neighboring elements.

# Content Area

### What Is the Content Area?
  - The innermost part of the box containing text, images, or other content.
  - Defined by properties like `width` and `height`.
### Example:
  ```css
  div {
    width: 200px;
    height: 100px;
    background-color: lightblue;
  }
  ```

### Note:
  - The total size of the element is affected by padding, border, and margin unless the `box-sizing` property is used.

---

# Padding

### What Is Padding?
  - The space between the content and the border.
  - Adds internal spacing inside the element, expanding its visual size.
### Example:

  ```css
  div {
    padding: 20px;
    background-color: lightcoral;
  }
  ```

### Shorthand for Padding:
  - `padding: 10px;` (all sides).
  - `padding: 10px 20px;` (top/bottom, left/right).
  - `padding: 10px 20px 15px;` (top, left/right, bottom).
  - `padding: 10px 20px 15px 5px;` (top, right, bottom, left).

---

# Borders

### What Is the Border?
  - The line surrounding the padding or content of an element.
  - Can have style, width, and color.
### Example:

  ```css
  div {
    border: 2px solid black;
  }
  ```

### Border Shorthand:
  - `border: 2px dashed red;`
### Border Radius:
  - Add rounded corners with `border-radius`.
  - Example: `border-radius: 10px;`

---

# Margin

### What Is the Margin?
  - The space outside the border that separates an element from its neighbors.
  - Does not affect the elementâ€™s size.
### Example:

  ```css
  div {
    margin: 20px;
  }
  ```

### Shorthand for Margin:
  - `margin: 10px;` (all sides).
  - `margin: 10px 20px;` (top/bottom, left/right).
  - `margin: 10px 20px 15px;` (top, left/right, bottom).
  - `margin: 10px 20px 15px 5px;` (top, right, bottom, left).

---

# Practical Example: Box Model in Action

### Combining Margin, Padding, and Border:
  - Example:

    ```css
    div {
      width: 200px;
      height: 100px;
      margin: 20px;
      padding: 10px;
      border: 5px solid blue;
      background-color: lightgreen;
    }
    ```

  ### Visual Breakdown:
      - Content: 200px x 100px.
    - Padding: Adds 10px inside the border.
    - Border: 5px width, blue color.
    - Margin: Adds 20px of space outside the element.

---

# Summary and Best Practices

### Key Points:
  - The box model defines how element dimensions and spacing are calculated.
  - Padding adds space inside the element; margin adds space outside.
  - Border surrounds the padding and content.
### Tips:
  - Use `box-sizing: border-box;` to include padding and border in the total width/height calculation.
  - Visualize the box model using browser dev tools for debugging.
  - Use consistent spacing for better design.

# CSS Animations: Introduction
### What Are CSS Animations?
  - CSS animations allow you to create smooth transitions between states without JavaScript.
  - Two main components:
    1. **@keyframes**: Defines the animation behavior.
    2. **Animation Properties**: Control how the animation is applied.
### Why Use CSS Animations?
  - Improve user experience (e.g., loading indicators, hover effects).
  - Enhance visual appeal with smooth transitions.
### Example:
  ```css
  @keyframes slideIn {
    from {
      transform: translateX(-100%);
    }
    to {
      transform: translateX(0);
    }
  }
  ```

---

# Using `@keyframes`

### Defining Keyframes:
  - The `@keyframes` rule defines the intermediate steps of the animation.
  - Use `from` and `to` or percentage values.
### Example:

  ```css
  @keyframes fadeIn {
    0% {
      opacity: 0;
    }
    100% {
      opacity: 1;
    }
  }
  ```

### How It Works:
  - `0%` marks the starting point.
  - `100%` marks the endpoint.
  - Intermediate steps (e.g., `50%`) can be defined for more control.

---

# Animation Properties

### Key Animation Properties:
  1. **`animation-name`:** Specifies the name of the `@keyframes`.
  2. **`animation-duration`:** Duration of the animation.
  3. **`animation-timing-function`:** Speed curve of the animation.
  4. **`animation-delay`:** Time before the animation starts.
### Example:

  ```css
  div {
    animation-name: fadeIn;
    animation-duration: 2s;
    animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;
    animation-delay: 1s;
  }
  ```

---

# Animation Timing Functions

### Controlling Animation Speed:
  - Predefined values: `linear`, `ease`, `ease-in`, `ease-out`, `ease-in-out`.
  - Custom speed curves with `cubic-bezier()`.
### Example:

  ```css
  div {
    animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.42, 0, 0.58, 1);
  }
  ```

### Visualizing Timing Functions:
  - Use tools like [Cubic Bezier Generator](https://cubic-bezier.com/) to design curves.
  - Default `ease` starts slow, accelerates, then slows down.

---

# Combining Multiple Properties

### Shorthand for Animations:
  - Use `animation` shorthand to combine all animation properties.
  - Syntax: `animation: name duration timing-function delay iteration-count direction;`
### Example:

  ```css
  div {
    animation: fadeIn 2s ease-in-out 1s infinite alternate;
  }
  ```

  - `infinite`: Animation loops indefinitely.
  - `alternate`: Reverses direction on every loop.

---

# Practical Example: Bouncing Ball

### Code Example:

  ```css
  @keyframes bounce {
    0%, 100% {
      transform: translateY(0);
    }
    50% {
      transform: translateY(-50px);
    }
  }

  .ball {
    animation: bounce 1s ease-in-out infinite;
    width: 50px;
    height: 50px;
    background-color: red;
    border-radius: 50%;
  }
  ```
---

# Practical Example: Bouncing Ball 2

### HTML:

  ```html
  <div class="ball"></div>
  ```

### What Happens:
  - The ball moves up and down in a continuous loop, creating a bouncing effect.

---

# Summary and Best Practices

### Key Takeaways:

  - Use `@keyframes` to define the animation steps.
  - Combine animation properties with the `animation` shorthand for simplicity.
  - Use timing functions to create smooth and natural effects.

### Best Practices:

  - Avoid excessive animations that may harm user experience.
  - Test performance, especially on mobile devices.
  - Use animations to guide user focus and improve usability.

# CSS for Mobile Development: Introduction

### What Is Mobile Development in CSS?
  - CSS techniques used to create responsive, optimized, and touch-friendly designs for mobile devices.

### Why It Matters:
  - Over 50% of web traffic comes from mobile devices.
  - Ensures usability and performance across various screen sizes and resolutions.

### Key Focus Areas:

  1. Responsive design.
  2. Media queries.
  3. Flexible layouts.
  4. Performance optimization.

---

# Responsive Design Basics

### Responsive Design:

  - Adapts the layout to different screen sizes and devices.
  - Achieved through flexible grids, images, and media queries.

### Core Concepts:
  1. **Fluid Grids:** Use relative units like `%`, `vw`, and `vh` for layout elements.
  2. **Flexible Images:** Set images to scale with the layout using `max-width: 100%;`.
  3. Viewport Meta Tag:
       ```html
     <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
     ```
### Example:
  ```css
  .container {
    width: 90%;
    max-width: 1200px;
    margin: 0 auto;
  }
  ```

---

# Media Queries

### What Are Media Queries?

  - Enable conditional CSS based on device characteristics, like screen size or orientation.

### Syntax:

  ```css
  @media (max-width: 768px) {
    body {
      font-size: 14px;
    }
  }
  ```

  - `max-width`: Targets screens smaller than or equal to the specified width.
  - `min-width`: Targets screens larger than or equal to the specified width.

---

# Media Queries 2

### Common Breakpoints:

  - Mobile: `480px`
  - Tablets: `768px`
  - Desktops: `1024px`

### Best Practices:
  - Start with a mobile-first approach, using `min-width` to add styles for larger devices.

---

# Flexible Units for Mobile Design

### Why Flexible Units Matter:
  - Mobile devices have varying screen sizes and resolutions.
  - Avoid fixed units (e.g., `px`) in favor of flexible ones.
### Common Units:
  1. `%` for relative sizing (e.g., width and height).
  2. `em` and `rem` for scalable typography.
  3. `vw` and `vh` for viewport-relative sizing.
  - Example: `width: 50vw;` is 50% of the viewport width.
### Using `clamp()` for Adaptive Sizing:

  ```css
  h1 {
    font-size: clamp(1rem, 5vw, 2rem);
  }
  ```

---

# Mobile-First Layouts

### Key Principles:
  - Start designing for small screens first and scale up for larger devices.
  - Use simple layouts with vertical stacking for smaller screens.
### CSS Techniques:
  - Use flexbox for responsive layouts:

    ```css
    .container {
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: column;
    }
    ```

---

# Mobile-First Layouts 2

  - Grid layout for more complex designs:

    ```css
    .grid {
      display: grid;
      grid-template-columns: 1fr;
    }
    @media (min-width: 768px) {
      .grid {
        grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
      }
    }
    ```
